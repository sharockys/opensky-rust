# OpenSky Network Rust API
This is a Rust API for the OpenSky Network. It is a wrapper around the OpenSky Network REST API. Currently it's in a very early stage of development and only a few endpoints are implemented. The goal is to provide a complete wrapper around the OpenSky Network REST API.   
Eventually I want to make it a stream based API to feed Kafka or other message brokers with the data for Data Science purposes.
